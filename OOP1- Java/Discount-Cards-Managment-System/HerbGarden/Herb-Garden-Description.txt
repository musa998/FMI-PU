I provided two algoriths you can decide with one is better.
The program start with reading a array of numbers in format - "2 7 5 3" using stream and split i can separate the numbers and put them in array. After that i read number as ''int'' representing the number of days, after i have all of this information i can call the algorithms "getTotalHarvestLeaves" or "herbGarden". The first one takes two parameters and starts with initializing a variable called "totalLeaves", this valiable contains the number of leaves we harvest as total. After there is a loop that is performed depends of the number of days we can harvest.Inside the loop i call a "Arrays.sort" beause i need to take the plant with the most leaves and harvest the half of them i can easly find it by taking the last element of the array. After i add how many leaves i harvest in my variable "totalLeaves", and then substract the number of leaves i've take for the current day from the the array, and then there is the end of the  day and i add two more leaves to every plant.
The only defference with the second algorith is that i'm not sorting the array but i've made additional algorith that return the first largest found in the array.
